{"name":"Raptor","tagline":"Hosted Source Code Vulnerability Scanner","body":"# Raptor\r\n\r\nRaptor is a web-based (web-serivce + UI) github centric source-vulnerability scanner i.e. it scans a repository with just the github repo url. You can setup webhooks to ensure automated scans everytime you commit or merge a pull request. The scan is done asynchonously and the results are available only to the user who initiated the scan.\r\n\r\nSome of the features of the Raptor:\r\n  - Plug-in architecture (plug and play external tools and generate unified reports)\r\n  - Web-service can be leveraged for custom automation (without the need of the UI) \r\n  - Easy to create/edit/delete signatures for new vulnerabilities and/or programming languages.\r\n\r\n> This tool is an attempt to help the community and start-up companies to \r\n> emphasize on secure-coding. This tool may or may not match the features/quality of commercial alternatives, nothing is guaranteed and you have been warned. This tool is targetted to be used by security code-reviewers and/or developers with secure-coding experience to find vulnerability entrypoints during code-audits or peer reviews. Please DO NOT trust the tool's output blindly.\r\n> This is best-used if you plug Raptor into your CI/CD pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n0.1 beta\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nIntegrated Plugins (_currently_):\r\n* [Mozilla ScanJS] - for client-Side JavaScript, Node.JS, FireFox OS support\r\n* [Brakeman] - for Ruby On Rails support\r\n* [RIPS] - for PHP support\r\n* [Android] - for insecure permissions\r\n\r\nAvaiables Rulepacks (_currently_):\r\n* ActionScript - supports ActionScript 2.0 & 3.0 source/sinks\r\n* Java - partial support for Android.
