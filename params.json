{"name":"Raptor","tagline":"Hosted Source Code Vulnerability Scanner","body":"# Raptor\r\n![RaptorLogo](http://daspatnaik.com/raptor/logo.png)\r\nis a web-based (web-serivce + UI) github centric source-vulnerability scanner i.e. it scans a repository with just the github repo url. You can setup webhooks to ensure automated scans everytime you commit or merge a pull request. The scan is done asynchonously and the results are available only to the user who initiated the scan.\r\n\r\nSome of the features of the Raptor:\r\n  - Plug-in architecture (plug and play external tools and generate unified reports)\r\n  - Web-service can be leveraged for custom automation (without the need of the UI) \r\n  - Easy to create/edit/delete signatures for new vulnerabilities and/or programming languages.\r\n\r\n> This tool is an attempt to help the community and start-up companies to \r\n> emphasize on secure-coding. This tool may or may not match the features/quality of commercial alternatives, nothing is guaranteed and you have been warned. This tool is targetted to be used by security code-reviewers and/or developers with secure-coding experience to find vulnerability entrypoints during code-audits or peer reviews. Please DO NOT trust the tool's output blindly.\r\n> This is best-used if you plug Raptor into your CI/CD pipeline.\r\n\r\n### Version\r\n0.1 beta\r\n\r\n### Tech\r\n\r\nIntegrated Plugins:\r\n\r\nNote: Most of the following tools/modules/libs have been modified heavily to be able to integrate well in the framework.\r\n\r\n* :zap: [Mozilla ScanJS] - for JavaScript (Client-Side, Node.JS etc. and upcomming support for Chrome Extensions & Firefox Plugins)\r\n* :zap: [Brakeman] - for Ruby On Rails\r\n* :zap: [RIPS] - for PHP\r\n* :zap: [Manitree] - for AndroidManifest.xml insecurities\r\n\r\nAvaiables Rulepacks:\r\n* :zap: ActionScript - supports Flash/Flex (ActionScript 2.0 & 3.0) source/sinks\r\n* :zap: [FindSecurityBugs]  (rules Only) - for Java (J2EE, JSP, Android, Scala, Groovy etc.)\r\n* :zap: [gitrob] (rules only) - for Sensitive Date Exposure (files containing credentials, configuration, backup, private settings etc.)\r\n\r\n### Installation (Tested on a Ubuntu 14.04 x64 LAMP instance)\r\n\r\nInstallation Video: [YouTube Install]\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ wget https://github.com/dpnishant/raptor/archive/master.zip -O raptor.zip\r\n```\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ unzip raptor.zip\r\n$ cd raptor-master\r\n$ sudo sh install.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Usage\r\n#####Scanner\r\nInstallation Video: [YouTube Usage]\r\n```sh\r\ncd raptor-master\r\nsudo sh start.sh #starts the backend web-service\r\n```\r\nNow point your browser to [Raptor Home]\r\n\r\n######Login\r\nLogin with the username as registered on the corresponding github server you are connected to and *any* password (but remember the username to view scan history)\r\n\r\nFor example: \r\n\r\nIf you are registered as `foobar` on https://github.com, then use the same username when scanning repos on https://github.com. However if are registered as `foobar_corp` on your personal/corporate github (say https://github.corp.company.com) then use the same username if you intend to scan repos on https://github.corp.company.com\r\n\r\nHowever, as of now password can be anything, since we have *NOT* implemented a database in the development version.\r\n\r\n#####Rules Editor\r\nYou can use the bundled light-weight, GUI client-side rules editor for adding any new/custom rule(s) for your specific requirements(s) or any other plain-text editor as the rulepack files are just simple JSON structures. Use your browser to open rules located in 'backend/rules'. When you are done, save your new/modified rules file in same directory i.e. 'backend/rules'. All you need to do now is a minor edit, here: [Init Script]. Append your new rulepack filename to this array without the '.rulepack' extension and restart the backend server. You are all set! :thumbsup:\r\n\r\nYou can access it here: [Rules Editor]\r\n\r\n#####Public/Private GitHub instance\r\nYou can use Raptor to scan your organization's private as well as public instances of GitHub by specifiying the right server endpoints at [here][github_configs].\r\n\r\n### Development\r\n\r\nWant to contribute?
